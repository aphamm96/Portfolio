                    <p>I am Alexander Hamm and I am currently a junior software developer looking to break into the gaming industry. I graduated Ivy Tech in 2017 with a degree in machining, but the work left me unfulfilled and wanting more. With the COVID-19 crisis I decided to take up training with Indiana's Eleven Fifty Academy to learn software development and other fundamentals like HTML and CSS. Outside of work, I enjoy solving puzzles, writing, playing video games, and playing Dungeons and Dragons.</p>

                    <p>Possibly put images here, but put the CSS Creature, the Drofsnar, the storefront website, and whatever else comes up. Note: really improve the CSS creature and the storefront before making public.</p>

                    <p>Pretty sure make this a list with the name, email, etc. Might have to java it or something to make it work. Or just put contact details, that works too.
